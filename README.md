# HexNicks

## What is HexNicks?

HexNicks gives players the ability to change their nickname to anything they like using both hex color codes and normal color codes. It also adds the ability to use hex color codes in chat.

Why did I create such a basic plugin?

Because I hadn't seen one like it (doesn't mean there isn't one) and a lot of people seem quite taken with the added support for hex codes, so here's an easy way for small servers to implement them.

## Commands:

`/nick <nickname>` - change your nickname

`/nick help` - get help :p

`/nonick` - remove your nickname

## How to use:

You can find the standard Minecraft color codes here, for hex color codes you must use the format &#rrggbb. I've left an image below displaying a lot of different color codes. Simply add the &# before one of the codes shown below to include that color in your name.

## Permissions:

By default, everyone can change their nicknames. If you want only a certain group to be able to, you can enable permissions in the config file and then only players with hexnicks.use will be able to change their nicknames.

## Introducing gradients!

Now HexNicks makes it easy to get beautiful gradients in your nicknames. The formatting is simple, for the example above the command was: `/nick <gradient:#1eae98:#d8b5ff>Majekdor</gradient>`

> Note: The closing tag is optional if you don't want anything after the initial text.

The first gradient tag can also take more than 2 hex codes, though they must be in the standard six-character hex format.


## Hex Colors:

I'll just leave this here for you :)
